 (1459,'Daryl Morrie','CSR','2009-06-05','243394','email','customer',1,'Gary,\r\n\r\nI would like to take the time to congratulate Borland on employing Daryl Morrie.\r\nDaryl is a wonderful asset to your company. He was not only pleasant (actually very funny), professional, and patient but wonderful to work with in an extremely stressful situation.\r\nI was notified via email Thursday morning (after I just came back from vacation) there was a need for an upgrade on a Visibroker license. This email had been passed around since Friday the week before. Unfortunately, I also had 2 other deadlines which I have missed due to the urgent nature surrounding the upgrade. There were 30 servers on hold because of the license needing an upgrade, and had been on hold since Friday! Needless to say I was a bit frantic. I needed to get a contract ID number and password in order to upgrade the license. In order to obtain the these I needed to provide you folks with the (po) purchase order number. Unfortunately, the fellow who created the po was let go and no one was able to provide me with the po. The search to narrow down the po to a few with the help of SHI (Software House International), correct project, etc. took 6 hours.\r\nBy the time Daryl answered the phone, I was frazzled and praying you folks would be able to understand my dilemma and assist. With the serial number of the server, he was able to narrow it down to the po the license was purchased on and set up a contract ID and password, and provide a link and password to upgrade not only that license but the other licenses on that po!\r\n\r\nIt may have been a normal day for Daryl, but I must say, he was our savior and godsend.\r\nHe was able to calmly talk/walk me through your processes and belay my worries.\r\nAND SO QUICKLY!\r\nMy husband thanks you as well, as I was working from home and having a happy wife at home sure made the difference for him.\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom of my heart - THANK YOU Daryl!\r\n\r\nJudy E. Hill :)| ','Y'),
